# Vault Envrc Generator — Project Overview

Welcome to the Vault Envrc Generator, a powerful CLI tool that transforms how you work with HashiCorp Vault secrets. Instead of wrestling with complex API calls and manual secret extraction, this tool provides a simple, configuration-driven approach to generate environment files, configuration documents, and automate secret management workflows.

## What This Tool Solves

Managing secrets across development, staging, and production environments is challenging. Traditional approaches often involve:
- **Manual secret extraction** from Vault web UI or complex CLI commands
- **Inconsistent formatting** across different applications and environments
- **Repetitive tasks** when managing multiple services or environments
- **Error-prone processes** when secrets change or new services are added
- **Security concerns** with secrets scattered across different configuration methods

The Vault Envrc Generator eliminates these pain points by providing a unified, automated approach to secret management that scales from simple single-service setups to complex multi-environment deployments.

## Core Capabilities

The tool provides five main capabilities that cover the complete secret management lifecycle:

### **Extract & Transform Secrets**
Pull secrets from any Vault path and transform them into the exact format your applications need. Whether you need shell environment variables, JSON configuration files, or YAML manifests, the tool handles the conversion automatically.

### **Batch Processing**
Process multiple Vault paths with sophisticated configuration rules. A single YAML configuration file can define dozens of secret extraction operations, each with different filtering, transformation, and output requirements.

### **Multi-Format Output**
Generate consistent output in multiple formats:
- **`.envrc` files** for shell environments and direnv integration
- **JSON files** for API consumption and structured configuration
- **YAML files** for Kubernetes secrets and application configuration

### **Reverse Operations**
Populate Vault with secrets from local sources including environment variables, configuration files, and static data. Perfect for initial setup and migration scenarios.

### **Discovery & Exploration**
Explore Vault hierarchies with structured output, making it easy to understand how secrets are organized and what's available for your applications.

## Design Philosophy

The tool is built around three core principles that make secret management more reliable and maintainable:

### Configuration as Code
Instead of remembering complex command-line invocations, define your secret extraction workflows in YAML configuration files. These configurations are versionable, reviewable, and reusable across environments.

### Environment Parity
Use the same tooling and configuration patterns across development, staging, and production environments. This consistency reduces errors and makes deployments more predictable.

### Intelligent Automation
The tool automatically handles Vault API complexities like KV engine version detection, token resolution, and connection health checking. You focus on what secrets you need, not how to get them.

## Command Overview

The tool provides five commands, each designed for specific workflows while sharing common infrastructure and consistent behavior.

### batch — Multi-Environment Processing

The `batch` command is the powerhouse for complex secret management scenarios. It processes YAML configuration files that define multiple jobs, each containing multiple sections with different processing rules.

**Perfect for:**
- **Complete application environments** where secrets come from multiple Vault paths
- **Multi-service deployments** requiring different secret formats and transformations
- **CI/CD pipelines** that need consistent, repeatable secret extraction
- **Development workflows** where multiple developers need identical environment setups

**Key Features:**
- Process dozens of Vault paths in a single operation
- Apply different transformation rules to different secret groups
- Generate multiple output formats simultaneously
- Continue processing even if individual operations fail
- Use templates for dynamic path construction

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Single command generates complete environment
vault-envrc-generator batch --config production.yaml
# Creates: database.envrc, api-keys.json, k8s-secrets.yaml
```

### generate — Quick Secret Extraction

The `generate` command focuses on single-path operations with immediate output. It's designed for quick secret extraction and simple transformation workflows.

**Perfect for:**
- **Debugging and exploration** when you need to see what's in a specific Vault path
- **Single-service applications** that only need secrets from one location
- **Shell scripting** where you need specific secrets for automation
- **Testing connectivity** and permissions to Vault

**Key Features:**
- Extract secrets from any single Vault path
- Transform keys to environment variable format
- Filter secrets to include only what you need
- Output directly to stdout or files
- Support for custom output templates

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Quick database configuration extraction
vault-envrc-generator generate --path secrets/app/database --format envrc
# Outputs: export DATABASE_HOST="...", export DATABASE_PASSWORD="..."
```

### list — Vault Discovery

The `list` command provides comprehensive exploration of Vault contents with structured output options. It's essential for understanding how secrets are organized and what's available.

**Perfect for:**
- **Initial exploration** of unfamiliar Vault instances
- **Auditing and documentation** of secret organization
- **Debugging access permissions** and path availability
- **Understanding secret structure** before writing batch configurations

**Key Features:**
- Recursive exploration of Vault hierarchies
- Multiple output formats (table, JSON, YAML, CSV)
- Optional value display with security censoring
- Depth control for large secret trees
- Integration with other tools through structured output

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Explore application secrets structure
vault-envrc-generator list --path secrets/app --format table
# Shows organized view of all available secrets
```

### seed — Vault Population

The `seed` command reverses the typical flow by populating Vault with secrets from local sources. This is essential for development workflows and initial system setup.

**Perfect for:**
- **Initial Vault setup** when migrating from other secret storage
- **Development environment bootstrapping** with necessary secrets
- **Local-to-Vault migrations** from environment variables or files
- **Testing scenarios** where you need predictable secret data

**Key Features:**
- Combine static data, environment variables, and file contents
- Use the same template system as other commands
- Preview operations before making changes
- Validate all data sources before starting

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Populate development Vault from local configuration
vault-envrc-generator seed --config dev-setup.yaml --dry-run
# Preview: Shows what would be written to which Vault paths
```

### interactive — Quick Exploration

The `interactive` command provides a lightweight interface for rapid exploration and testing, perfect for learning the tool's capabilities.

**Perfect for:**
- **Learning the tool** without complex configuration files
- **Quick one-off operations** that don't warrant full configuration
- **Testing Vault connectivity** and basic functionality

## How It All Works Together

The tool's power comes from how these commands work together in real workflows:

### Development Workflow
1. **Explore** available secrets with `list`
2. **Extract** specific secrets for testing with `generate`
3. **Create** comprehensive environment with `batch`
4. **Populate** development Vault with `seed` as needed

### Production Deployment
1. **Configure** complete extraction workflow with `batch` YAML
2. **Generate** all required configuration files in one operation
3. **Deploy** applications with consistent, verified secret configuration
